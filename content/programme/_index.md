The symposium is broadly organized into three topics, one per day:
atoms, molecules, and solids. For each topic, there will be two
tutorials given by leading experts in the field, one regarding
experimental techniques and one regarding theoretical methods
applicable to this topic. In addition, there will be traditional
invited talks, as well as _invited paper talks_, which focus on one
specific paper, with ample time for discussion with the
author. Naturally, there will also be contributed talks (6 slots) as
well as poster sessions at the end of each day.
