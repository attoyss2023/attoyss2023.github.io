The symposium is broadly organized into three topics, one per day:
atoms, molecules, and solids. For each topic, there will be two
tutorials given by leading experts in the field, one regarding
experimental techniques and one regarding theoretical methods
applicable to this topic. In addition, there will be traditional
invited talks, as well as _invited paper talks_, which focus on one
specific paper, with ample time for discussion with the
author. Naturally, there will also be contributed talks (6 slots) as
well as poster sessions at the end of each day.

# Format

Our YSS 2023 will feature 4 different types of _oral presentations_:

## Tutorial Lectures

There will be 6 Tutorial Lectures given by our invited expert
speakers, subdivided into three main topics focussing on the ultrafast
electronic interactions in (1) atoms, (2) molecules and (3) condensed
matter. For each of the above topics, there will be one tutorial
covering the experimental aspects and techniques and one dedicated to
the theoretical methods needed to describe the pertinent phenomena.

The duration of each _tutorial lecture_ is of 60min subdivided in 50’ of
presentation followed by 10’ of questions, answer and discussion
(Q&A&D).

## Invited Lectures

There will be 4 Invited Lectures given by our invited speakers
covering both the experimental aspects and the theoretical methods
needed to describe the pertinent phenomena in the various types of
targets.  The duration of each _invited lecture_ is of 40min subdivided
in 35’ of presentation followed by 5’ of questions, answer and
discussion (Q&A&D).

## Invited Paper Lectures
There will be also 4 so-called “Invited Paper Lectures” given by
invited young researchers who will have the opportunity to present one
of their most recent works. Their lecture will focus on _one single
publication_ (made available on our homepage). The aim of such a paper
presentation is to stimulate prolonged and detailed discussions among
the speaker and the audience, giving the opportunity to discuss in
depth also the details of the presented work.

The duration of each _invited paper lecture_ is of 40min subdivided in
25’ of presentation followed by 15’ of questions, answer and
discussion (Q&A&D).

To promote a fruitful exchange and an active Q&A&D session, the
organizers strongly suggest to the audience to read these papers
beforehand. This should give the opportunity to formulate targeted
questions and to focus on the details of the presented work.

## Contributed Talks
We have also reserved 10 time slots of 20min duration each to
contributed talks where young researchers get the opportunity to
present and discuss their most recent work before an expert audience.

The duration of each _contributed talk_ is of 20min subdivided in 15’
of presentation followed by 5’ of questions, answer and discussion
(Q&A&D)

## Poster Session
We also wish to give ample opportunity to young scientist to discuss
their work in form of _poster_ presentations. To this end, we scheduled
two poster sessions at the end of the first two days of our
symposium. The poster sessions will be accompanied by a small buffet
with refreshments.

_Poster_ panels are in A0 size. The poster can be mounted already at the
beginning of the symposium and can be left hanging during the entire
duration of the symposium, so that participants can initiate and
continue discussions also during the coffee breaks.
